Senior-Design-Hydra
===================
Upon first pull run `rails g hydra:jetty`â€”this will install the Jetty bits necessary for hydra. This isn't included in the repo itself because the jetty files are somewhere close to 200MB and don't need to be shoveled to and from github.


###Running the application
all you need to do is `./start.sh`. This does:
- `rake jetty:start`
- `rails s -d`

So that you don't have to remember.
